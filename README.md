🌐 Wikipedia Search Engine — Project Summary
Overview:
The Wikipedia Search Engine project is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to search for Wikipedia articles directly from the browser. It utilizes the Wikipedia API to fetch and display search results based on user input.

🔧 Technologies Used:
HTML: To structure the web page (input field, button, and results section).
CSS: To style the interface with clean and responsive design.
JavaScript: To handle user interaction, API calls, and dynamic content rendering.

⚙️ Features:
Live Search Input: Users can enter keywords into a search box.
API Integration: Uses the Wikipedia API to fetch relevant article titles, snippets, and links.
Search Results Display: Shows a list of matching Wikipedia articles with:

Title of the article
A short description/snippet
A link to open the full article on Wikipedia in a new tab
Responsive Design: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

💡 How It Works:

JavaScript sends an AJAX request to the Wikipedia API.
The API returns a list of matching articles.
JavaScript dynamically adds the results to the page.

🚀 Learning Outcomes:
Understanding how to use public APIs.
Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.
